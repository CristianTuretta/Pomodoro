# Pomodoro
Pomodoro is a macOS status bar application which allows you to control your work and break time.

Through this application you will be able to control your work and break time. It features two modes:
1. _Pomodoro_, 25 minutes working and 5 minutes to take a break
2. _Double Pomodoro_, 50 minutes working and 10 minutes to take a break

Once started and selected one mode, the application will automatically tell you when it is time to take a break and to work. Scheduling your time in this way will increase your productivity, it worked for me :)

## Demo
The application looks like this on the stauts bar, it is minimal and easy to use.
